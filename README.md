## Getting Started

After cloning the repository into your machine, navigate to the root of the repository and then run the following command:

### `yarn install`

In order to install all of the corresponding packages.

After installing the packages, head on the `packages/server` folder and rename the file called `.env.example` to `.env.`

Afterwards, replace the string in the `dbUrl` variable to the connection string used in your mongodb database.

## Running the App

After you've finished setting everything up, all you need to do is to run:

### `yarn dev`

In order to concurrently run both the server and the client.
